## Introduction

GitHub flavored markdown has no automated table-of-contents generator.

## Why Another?

Really? Seriously?
There are lots of markdown TOC tools out there.
Why did we need another one?

I used https://luciopaiva.com/markdown-toc/ but didn't
like the cut-and-paste.

I tried https://github.com/ekalinin/github-markdown-toc
but didn't like the dependency on curl and didn't love
the code either.
I'm sure there's another one out there that I would like,
although I have spent a little while looking,
but what the heck -- I like to code.
